# Web_Visualization_Dashboard
Building a dashboard and create individual pages for each plot and a means by which it can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. It will also have a landing page, a page where it can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where it can view the data used to build them.

## Website Layout

![Website Cover and Index file](https://github.com/samuelroiz/Web_Visualization_Dashboard/blob/main/images/index_page.png) 

<p> This is the cover of the website and if you click on the top left corner, "Latitude", it will take you back to this page. </p>

<p> In the top right corner, you have four images to choose from. The first one has maxed temperature versus latitude. The second is humidity versus latitude. The third is cloudiness versus latitude. Fourth is wind speed versus latitude. To choose one of the four is by selecting or clicking the image you want to look at closer. </p>

#### 4
![Wind Speed](https://github.com/samuelroiz/Web_Visualization_Dashboard/blob/main/images/wind_speed_page.png) 

<p> In the top right corner of the page, there are three buttons. The button that says "Plots" will allow you to access the four images above in a different route. The button has a feature called dropdown. The button next to it is called "Comparison."  It will take all four graphs and compare each other on one page. Finally, the last button is the data. Once clicked on, it will display the data for the graphs. </p>
